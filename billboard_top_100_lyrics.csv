A Bar Song (Tipsy),A Bar Song (Tipsy),"[Verse 1]
My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This
nine-to-five ain't workin
', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh
[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord
[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
[Post-Chorus]
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
[Verse 2]
I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh Lord

Birds Of A Feather,Birds Of A Feather,"[Intro]
[Verse 1]
I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you (Alright)
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
[Refrain]
Birds of a feather, we should stick together

I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
[Chorus]

'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

I Had Some Help,I Had Some Help,"[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, ""Teamwork makes the dream work""
Hell, I had some help (Help)
[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]

[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]
You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this

Lose Control,Lose Control,"[Verse 1]
Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know
[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
[Verse 2]
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh
